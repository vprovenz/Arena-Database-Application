Hi! Our source code is in the JAVA files. Within these files are the sql statements for the deliverables.
However, these SQL statements are highlighted in green in the "ViewDeliverableSql.pdf" to make them easier to find should you not want to sift through the source code.

The rest of our SQL statements are in the "ProejctSql.sql" file.
